A windows 10 StackOverflow notification program

This project is slowly being developed. I am a constant user of StackOverflow. Most of my time I am browsing different solutions piecemeiling how a framework comes together. Every now and then I will actually ask a question to a problem. Normally while looking at code I try to keep my browser distraction free and most of the time closed. However in order to get my updates to the sparing questions I have on StackOverflow I created this simple program in order to notify me when I have an update. The list below are my general ideas on where I see development going.

## Milestones

### 1. Get it Running
 - ~~Data Pulling from StackOverflow~~
 - ~~Show the toast in a windows 10 system~~
 - ~~Display all messages in order to navigate at will~~
 - ~~Create an installer~~
 - ~~A hosted solution for others to download updates~~

### 2. Increasing functionality
 - Enfocing only a single instance to be open at a time.
 - ~~Get the app to have an option to put itself in the startup queue~~
 - Add a more complete profile overview
 - Add additional analytics for the data that is being offered. 
 - Allow for notifications from other StackExchange communities.
 - Allow for customisable options on what displays notifications.
